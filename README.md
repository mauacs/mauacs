### Hi! Welcome to my Developer Profile.

<hr />

I'm Software Engineer that really loves learning new technologies all the time. But technologies don't make sense for herserves, if you know what I mean. There's no sense in developing stuff if they don't serve as an improvement in people's lives. Even more than that, they can and should work to empower people, to make things possible, to even turn living possible. 

It doesn't matter who you are, what kind of different abilities you have, what are the senses you use to absorb the world, digital solutions must serve your needs and goals. 

We as developers have this power and responsibilites to make the world better for so many people that struggle with the way the current scenario of digital services are. 

Universal design and Acessibility are keys to our roles and we should know better and apply consistently the tools and techniques they offer to give people the chance to be better selves - or whatever they wanna be, right?
